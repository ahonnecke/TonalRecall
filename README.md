## How to Run

Run the following command to start the game with the Pygame UI at level 3:

```bash
uv run python ./tonal_recall/main.py --ui pygame --level 3
```

- `--ui pygame`: Launches the graphical interface using Pygame
- `--level 3`: Starts the game at level 3 (see below for level details)

## About Levels

The game supports multiple levels of difficulty. Higher levels may introduce more notes, faster sequences, or more complex patterns. Example breakdown:

- **Level 1:** Basic note recognition, slow tempo, fewer notes
- **Level 2:** Moderate difficulty, more notes, slightly faster
- **Level 3:** Advanced, full set of notes, increased speed and complexity

Adjust the `--level` parameter to match your skill or training needs!
