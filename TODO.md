# TODO

I'm writing a game to help myself learn to play bass.

The way the game words is similar to rocksmith, but more learning focused.

I need help figuring out what the next "levels" are going to be.

Right now, the levels are just note flashcards, it shows an "A", you play an
"A", it shows an "F", you play an "F", and it records your notes per second.

The levels add more notes as you progress:
- Open strings
- Whole notes
- Sharps too
- SPN, octaves 1 and 2
- SPN, octaves 1-3
- SPN, octaves 1-4

I'm interested in adding more levels after this, but I'm unsure as to what would
be the most helpful.

Here's my list:

1. Interval Recognition and Playing

    Introduce intervals (e.g. minor 2nd, perfect 4th, major 5th).

    Game shows "Play a perfect fifth from A" → you play A and E.

    Focus: Ear training + fretboard shapes.

2. Scale Degrees

    Prompt by degree: “Play the 3rd degree of G major.”

    Introduces functional thinking instead of raw notes.

3. Scales

    Start with major and minor scales.

    Game gives a root and asks for a full scale run.

    Could introduce "follow the lights" style prompts or scrolling tabs.

4. Chord Tones

    Emphasize 1–3–5–7 of major, minor, and dominant chords.

    Useful for building basslines and recognizing harmony.

5. Arpeggios

    Play arpeggios up and down from a root.

    Could focus on position shifts, fingerings, or ear-based recall.

6. Groove Exercises

    Simple repeating basslines (8th or 16th notes).

    Add rhythmic precision and feel. Could score timing accuracy.

7. Common Patterns/Riffs

    Teach common walking basslines, funk riffs, punk lines, etc.

    Encourage internalization of genre idioms.

8. String Skipping and Position Shifting

    Exercises that require jumping across non-adjacent strings or moving up/down the neck.

9. Sight Reading Rhythms

    Introduce basic notation: whole, half, quarter, 8th notes.

    User sees rhythm pattern and must match it while playing a specified note.

10. Play-Along Mode

    Simple backing track (metronome, drums, or chords).

    Prompts still appear, but you must stay in time.
